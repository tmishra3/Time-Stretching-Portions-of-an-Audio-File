# Time Stretching Portions of an Audio File

### The following was an interview question for Ableton to develop an approach for time stretching sections of an audio file independently of each other (as in, you can break the audio file into as many sections as needed and independently stretch and shrink them to slow down/speed up the tempo within those sections).

### As this is an explanation of my approach, for the sake of mathematical formatting, I've included the PDF file I submitted to the company.
